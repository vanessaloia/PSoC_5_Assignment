# PSoC_5_Assignment

I2C communication between the PSoC_5 microcontroller (master) and LIS3DH accelerometer (slave).
##  Project2.1 ##
In Project 2.1 the temperature sensor's  output is read and data are send through UART to the terminal
## Project 2.2 ##
In Project 2.2 the accelerometer's output is read in Normal mode (100 Hz) with a full scale range of +/- 2g and 10-bits resolution. 
Data are converted in mg with a sensitivity of 4 mg/digit and 2 bytes for each data are sent though UART with a baud rate of 9600 bps.
Data are plotted with Bridge Control Panel: also variable settings and editor are submitted.
## Project 2.3 ##
In Project 2.3 the accelerometer's output is read in High resolution mode mode (100 Hz) with a full scale range of +/- 4g and 12-bits 
resolution. Data are converted in mg with a sensitivity of 2 mg/digit and then in m/s^2 taking in account four decimals.
4 bytes for each data are sent though UART with a baud rate of 19200 bps. Data are plotted with Bridge Control Panel: also variable 
settings and editor are submitted.
